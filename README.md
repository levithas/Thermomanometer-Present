# Thermomanometer
The program displays the current temperature and air pressure on an LED strip. Temperature is shown in Â°C and air pressure in hPa. For a little twist, there is a riddle hidden inside the program, that displays a message when specific parameters are met.

### Hardware
- ESP8266 (Microcontroller)
- BMP180 (Temperature and air pressure sensor)
- Neopixel LED strip (configured for 20 LEDs)
- 2 green LEDs

The microcontroller is powered by the build-in USB port.

### Motivation
This tool was created and is maintained by a group of students as a gift for a very, very, very talented and generous colleague!
